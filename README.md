# HighlighterExtension
Browser Extension, that allows you to save any snippet of text (along with its origin) on any webpage, simply by highlighting it.

**Note:** This functionality already exists, but AFAIK only proprietary extensions exist - no Open Source extension does this.

## TODO
- Implement the basic functionality (mentioned in description).
- Add different highlight color
